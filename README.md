Recently I have started to look into the collection and analysis of Tweets, and getting familiar with a couple of the popular natural language processing libraries in Python (and R later on), here is a repository of the scripts.  
There are two main data sets I have collected so far, one is Tweets relating to the Australian One Nation party over two weeks time in August, about six weeks after the Federal Election 2016; second data set contains Tweets regarding to the space exploration computer/video game - No Man's Sky, shortly before and after the release.
