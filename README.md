# Trying out vairous analysis on Tweets

This is a simple repository of my attempt at analysing Tweets.  

### Files:  
db2df - script to retrieve data (tweets) from MongoDB into Python pandas dataframe  
onp_01_sentiment_afinn - sentiment measurement of tweets with weighted sentiment words from AFINN  
onp_02_wc - various word clouds of the tweets  
onp_03_topic_modelling - attempt at topic modelling, does not take into account of common phrases (this in next part)  
onp_04_topic_modelling_phrases - also topic modelling, but this time take into account of common phrases  

#### Note: for file onp_03_topic_modelling and onp_04_topic_modelling_phrases, use the html file version (in Docs folder) for better viewing of the models, or simply goto https://n-lo.github.io/Tweets_analysis_tryout/
